-PHONE RINGS-


DAD
Hey there, boyo, your mom and I are about five minutes out. Want us to stop by?


GREG
Actually, I’ve-


MOM
Oh, we’ll just pop our heads in and say hi! Try and pick up a bit before we get there, hun, and put Mr. Tinkles away, too. The scratch on your father’s butt from the last time he played with Mr. Tinkles is still healing, don’t’cha know!


DAD
Hee hee! Speed bumps are my worst nightmare these days! Anyhoo, see you soon son!


GREG
But-


-PHONE CLICKS, THEY HANG UP-


GREG
Oh no, I need to pick up this trash and laundry, and put Mr. Tinkles away quick.


________________


ON TAKING OUT THE TRASH:


GREG
I don’t have time to take this to the dump yet. I better throw it out the window and take it when mom and pop leave.




ON CLEANING UP THE LAUNDRY:


GREG
I just need to throw these somewhere they won’t see them… Hmmmm… maybe these can go out the window too… Some of them are too stained…




ON OPENING THE FRIDGE:


GREG
Oh no, there’s no room in here. Not with my dad’s kidney refrigerating and all. Better find somewhere else.




ON CHECKING THE NIGHTSTAND:


GREG
My tools are in here. Mr. Tinkles won’t fit in there, anyway.




ON CHECKING UNDER THE BED:


GREG
He might fit under here, but then where would I put this suitcase full of money?




ON CHECKING BEHIND THE CLOTHES CHANGER:


GREG
Oh god, George (or Harambe)… you’re still back there? You’ve gotta get out, buddy. Can’t have my parents knowing about you.




ON CHECKING THE SAFE:


-SAFE MAKES NOISES, BUMPS-


VOICE
GROWWWWLLLL. ARGGHHHHH. SLAMMM. YELLLP.
Or
Let me outta here! I can’t see where I am! What’s all this glowing green stuff in here? Hellllp!


GREG
That’s no good. I can’t even remember the code to open that safe. Better hide Mr. Tinkles elsewhere.




ON CHECKING THE BOOKSHELF




-IT ROTATES, REVEALING THE OTHER SIDE-


GREG
Yikes… I can’t think of a single way to explain all of this. Better just put that back.


ON BLOOD DRIPPING:


GREG
Not again! If I’d known the ceiling was so leaky, I wouldn’t have signed the lease for this place… Did I ever sign that lease? Hmmm… I guess I can’t ask Mr. Fredricksen anymore…


-his face changes to a suspicious one-


GREG
Better mop this up quick.




ON THE LIGHTS GOING OUT:


GREG
Oh, rats. Must have forgotten to pay the electric bill. Luckily I’ve rigged my own electricity if I can just find that switch…




ON BEES:


GREG
Shoot, how careless of me, I left the window open. Now there’s bees everywhere! I better kill them all before they take over the place, or attack me or Mr. Tinkles. I don’t want him to sting my dad in the butt either. For some reason wild animals always go for my dad’s butt.








PARENTS ARRIVE (GOOD ENDING)


MOM
Wow, son! Look at how nice and tidy your room is! You know I’m so proud of you, right?


DAD
Come on, let’s all go to dinner at Applebee’s. I hear they have half priced appetizers!


GREG
-Sigh of relief-


THE END






PARENTS ARRIVE (BAD ENDING)


DAD
My word! What kind of hullaballoo is this?


MOM
We have been fooled all this time! Our son is a no-good deviant! Consider yourself written out of our annual Christmas card!


GREG
No! But this year we were going to match sweaters with Santa gift-wrapping kittens! I already spent $200 on them!


MOM
Now the only sweater you’ll be wearing is whatever kind of sweaters they wear in rehab!


DAD
That’s right son, we’ll get you back on the straight and narrow. If it’s the last thing we ever do...


THE END
